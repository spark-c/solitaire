BUGS:
- when waste pile has only one card (card, nonecard, nonecard) and you try to place into tableau, I think it moves the nonecards before moving the real card. Added test to reproduce but not successful yet.

- Out of index error when attempting to parse an "s" cmd. Traceback:
    File "C:\Users\Collin Sparks\Desktop\code\solitaire\src\userinterface.py", line 187, in main_loop
    if self.current_input.is_valid:
    File "C:\Users\Collin Sparks\Desktop\code\solitaire\src\userinterface.py", line 46, in is_valid
        if cmd[0] == cmd[1]:
    IndexError: string index out of range


- Fix how "." is handled; if GAME_LOGIC is enabled, it should find how many visible cards there are and move that many.
- Switch empty amt to mean "all visible" instead of "only one/top card"

- Was unable to move cards from first tableau (index 0)
- too short input crashes in _enact() with str index out of range error Ln40

ENHANCEMENTS:
- Stack methods should return Stacks instead of List[Card]. I'd like to remove Stack.contents references, unnecessarily complicated. See TODO on Forward References.
