BUGS:
- Cannot place K on empty tableau "Tableau valeues must decrement"
- Fix how "." is handled; if GAME_LOGIC is enabled, it should find how many visible cards there are and move that many.
- Switch empty amt to mean "all visible" instead of "only one/top card"

- Was unable to move cards from first tableau (index 0)
- too short input crashes in _enact() with str index out of range error Ln40

ENHANCEMENTS:
- foundations initial suit detection
- Stack methods should return Stacks instead of List[Card]. I'd like to remove Stack.contents references, unnecessarily complicated. See TODO on Forward References.
