BUGS:
- Was unable to move cards from first tableau (index 0)
- too short input crashes in _enact() with str index out of range error Ln40
- NoneCards are being moved as cards and taking up space. Need to remove them after render.

ENHANCEMENTS:
- foundations initial suit detection
- Stack methods should return Stacks instead of List[Card]. I'd like to remove Stack.contents references, unnecessarily complicated. See TODO on Forward References.
